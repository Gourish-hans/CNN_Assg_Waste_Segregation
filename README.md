Waste Segregation using CNN

A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify waste into categories, supporting efficient recycling and waste management.

📌 Project Overview

Waste segregation is a crucial step in building sustainable and eco-friendly waste management systems. This project implements a CNN-based image classification model to identify different categories of waste (e.g., biodegradable, recyclable, hazardous, etc.).

The model is trained on an image dataset of waste items and demonstrates how computer vision can be leveraged for real-world sustainability challenges.
